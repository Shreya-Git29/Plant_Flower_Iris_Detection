# 🌿 Plant Iris Detection Model  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **machine learning-based Plant Iris Detection Model** to classify different species of **Iris flowers**. Using a **Decision Tree Algorithm**, the model achieves an accuracy of **95%**. The dataset includes measurements of petal and sepal dimensions, which are used to distinguish between different Iris species.
